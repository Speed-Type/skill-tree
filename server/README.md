## Testing

Import `postman_collection.json` into Postman to test all endpoints.

## Notes

- All dates are ISO 8601 format
- User deletion cascades to all their trees
- Authentication is cookie-based (httpOnly JWT). After a successful `/auth/login`,
  the browser automatically attaches the auth cookie to subsequent requests —
  no manual token handling required on the client. Requests must be made with
  `credentials: 'include'` (fetch) or `withCredentials: true` (axios) for the
  cookie to be sent, since the client and server run on different origins in dev.
- Endpoints marked "yours, after auth" in the tables below require a valid
  session; unauthenticated requests to these will receive a 401.
